        "Title": "Development of Tyre Maintenance and Operation App, including fitment of necessary IIoT related hardware in Dumpers",
        "Category": "Hardware",
        "Description": "Tyre cost is one of the most important O&M cost in dumpers. In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each. Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine \u2013 The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important. TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation. TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour) Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift. Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory. More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must. Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL\u2019s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle\u2019s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition. Tyre Pressure Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources. Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime. Tyre Performance Analysis Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres. Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.",

Description: It is a real-life problem in big Museum/ Science Museum/Centres, where there is inadequacy of manpower. Following are the problems in a nutshell that arose due to unnoticed and undiagnosed defects of the exhibits. High Maintenance Needs: Unlike static displays, interactive elements have more moving parts, software, and technology that require regular upkeep to function properly these are considered as \"\"golden parameters of any particular Exhibits\"\". Theses parameters are to be kept functional to keep the exhibits in a running condition. Frustration for Visitors: Encountering a non-functional exhibit can be frustrating for visitors, especially children, who may not understand why it's not working. Missed Learning Opportunities: Broken/ non-functional exhibits prevent visitors from fully engaging with the science concepts they're designed to teach. Because of their complexity, malfunctions might not be immediately obvious to visitors or staff, leading to a broken experience. Also creates a bad impression for that particular gallery and ultimately to the science center or to Science Museums. Expected Solution: Now, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, it transpires that amalgamation of Al with automation may give efficient result to detect defective exhibits placed in the galleries and give the feedback to the concerned section for immediate repairing initiative and rectify the exhibits. Thus, aiming a flawless learning experience or edutainment in Science Museum or in Science Center.",

        "Category": "Hardware",
        "Description": "Background: Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is the bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons. Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods. Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.",

To improve the productivity of animals a major focus area is to breed these animals using semen from high genetic merit bulls through Artificial lnsemination (Al). Al enables farmers to access the best bull (male) genetics. Farmers can improve the production, health traits, fertility and longevity of their dairy cattle by using a balanced approach to breeding. Animal health is also improved through the use of Al. Description: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery system in lndia. Semen doses are currently stored and transported using liquid nitrogen and specialized containers. However, significant losses of liquid nitrogen occur during storage and transportation, leading to escalated costs for maintaining the cold chain. The cost of liquid nitrogen itself is an issue. Mishandling of liquid nitrogen poses potential health hazards. The bulky and heavy nature of liquid nitrogen storage containers necessitates considerable resou rces for transportation. Expected solution: . There is a need to explore and promote alternative, cost-effective, and long-lasting methods for the storage and transportation of semen doses . The design, material, type of insulation of storage containers can also help in cost effectiveness, reduction in losses, compactness and ease of carrying to facilitate efficient distribution.",

For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985. Description: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities.

        "Description": "Background: The use of Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) technology for estimation of seasonal Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of crops at various growth stages is well establishd. Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.",

Unlike its fossil fuel counterpart, green hydrogen emits no greenhouse gasses at the point of use, making it ideal for hard-to-electrify sectors like heavy industry, long-distance transport, and steel production. This clean fuel can power vehicles and industrial processes, slashing emissions and combating climate change. Furthermore, green hydrogen's potential for energy storage allows for a more balanced and resilient renewable energy grid. As we strive for a net-zero future, green hydrogen is a crucial tool for a cleaner and more sustainable tomorrow. Description: Green hydrogen's potential for clean energy is undeniable. However, its widespread adoption faces a significant roadblock: high levelized cost. This cost, encompassing production, storage, and transportation, makes green hydrogen less competitive compared to traditional fossil fuels. This disparity discourages industries from switching to green alternatives. Government incentives, technological advancements, and economies of scale are all crucial to bridge this cost gap.

The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost. Description: Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5\u00b0C goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.

The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this. Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example: 60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam 40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam 30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam. Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student\u2019s responses.

Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as \u201cunexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,\u201d are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual\u2019s strength, balance, and mobility Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants\u2019 presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people. Expected Solution: These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers",

        "Category": "Software",
        "Description": "Description: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class. Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately. Detailed Description: Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler\u2019s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis. A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification. Expected Solution: Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird Output: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)",

        "Category": "Software",
        "Description": "Background: The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand. Description: The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs. Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive. Expected Solution: An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.",

India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal. Description: The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines. A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization. The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift\u2019s activities. Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life. Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same. This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine. Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. Possible Solution: An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines. Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.",

Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks. \u2022 Description: The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS. Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack: 1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range 2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version 3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint 4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes) There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also. For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made: 1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users. 2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability). 3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS). 4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver. 5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure. A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack. Expected Solution: A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.",

        "Description": "Background: The impact of oil spills at sea is multifaceted, affecting the environment, economy, public health, and society at large. Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. Detailed description: The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.

        "Category": "Software",
        "Description": "Background: INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis. Detailed Description: Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. Data input, classification and arrangement The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight. Users, Data output and visualization The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth. -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence. Data Accessibility The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data. Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.",

Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems. The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data. It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.

        "Category": "Software",
        "Description": "2.1 Background: 2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs. 2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved. 2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the \u2018price reasonability\u2019 for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors. 2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking. 2.2 Detailed Description: 2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows: i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates. ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price. iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey. 2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain. 2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach). 2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs. 2.3 Expected Solution: 2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness. 2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services. 2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.

        "Description": "Background Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. Description There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively.

        "Description": "Background: Namami Gange is a flagship program of the government of India for the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries. NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies. As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin. Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological & hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River. Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling. The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems. Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network. a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use. b.

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun\u2019s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink\u00ae, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink\u00ae Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.

        "Category": "Software",
        "Description": "Background: ODD School Structure refers to schools that do not conform to the standard categories defined by the Ministry of Education under the UDISE+ portal. These standard categories are designed to align with the Samagra Shiksha framework, which aims to ensure uniformity and consistency in the educational structures across the country. Schools falling outside these categories, due to variations in grade configurations, are classified as having \"\"odd structures.\"\" However, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the \"\"odd\"\" school structure category due to variations in grade configurations. These odd structures pose challenges for the uniform implementation of educational policies and schemes, such as Samagra Shiksha. This misalignment is particularly significant in states like Goa, Mizoram, West Bengal, and Kerala, where the majority of schools do not conform to the standard categories. Description: The problem of odd school structures affects the equitable distribution of resources, effective policy implementation, and the overall quality of education. Schools with odd structures are often excluded from the streamlined processes and benefits that come with standardization. The national average of schools with odd structures is 14.28%, but in some states, the percentage is much higher, complicating the delivery of educational initiatives. The objective is to standardize these odd school structures by aligning them with the defined categories under Samagra Shiksha, thereby improving the uniformity and effectiveness of educational policies across the country. Innovative Solutions: A. AI-Driven School Structure Analysis Tool: Develop software that uses AI to analyze school data and automatically classify schools into standard categories or identify them as odd structures. This tool can also suggest optimal restructuring options to align schools with the standard categories. B. Standardization Support Platform: Create a platform that provides guidelines, best practices, and resources for schools to transition from odd to standard structures. The platform could include modules on infrastructure planning, grade reconfiguration, and community engagement strategies. C. Dynamic Resource Allocation System: Develop a system that allows for flexible resource allocation based on school structures. This system would help in distributing resources more equitably by taking into account the specific needs of schools with odd structures during the transition period. D. Progress Monitoring Dashboard: Implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring the progress of schools as they transition from odd to standard structures. This dashboard would provide insights to policymakers and administrators, allowing them to track changes, identify bottlenecks, and intervene as necessary. E. Interactive Stakeholder Engagement Portal: Develop an online portal to engage with school administrators, teachers, and the community. This portal could include forums, feedback tools, and support resources to facilitate the transition to standard structures, ensuring that the process is inclusive and addresses local concerns.",

        "Description": "Background: Fuzzing is an automated process of identifying software vulnerabilities by supplying unexpected and faulty inputs to the software. The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps \u2013 1. Identification of Target Function(s) \u2013 Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data. 2. Developing harness \u2013 Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input. 3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis. Description: Fuzzing has proven its effectiveness in discovering thousands of vulnerabilities in file-processing and stateless applications. In fuzzing, and automated testing in general, designing test oracles is crucial. In this challenge the team is supposed to fuzz an open source software namely the Windows variant of Sumatra PDF Reader software (version 3.5.2 or later). Sumatra PDF Reader is a very popular open source and widely used PDF viewing software. In this challenge, teams are required to develop a working harness for fuzzing of the latest version (version 3.5.2 or later) of Windows Sumatra PDF Reader software solution, fuzzed on any fuzzer of their choice. The submission will be evaluated on the following criteria \u2013 1. Target functions identified 2. Live demonstration of fuzzing harness developed 3. Code Coverage achieved 4. Technical report submitted by the team. Expected Solution: Each team must provide a fuzzing harness that is capable of fuzzing the windows software solution of the Sumatra PDF Reader (version 3.5.2 or later). This fuzzing harness must identify target functions and supply appropriate arguments for the invocation of such functions. The fuzzing harness will be run using a fuzzer (preferably WinAFL). Each team must submit a working harness along with a technical report stating \u2013 1. Reversing steps undertaken 2. Target functions identified 3. Dependencies identified",

        "Category": "Software",
        "Description": "Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery. Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence. Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data. Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms. Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to: 1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs. 2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats. 3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files. 4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports. 5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.",

Assimilation of the situation and appreciating the potent threat with the help of 2-Dimensional layout turns out to be a challenging task. In such a scenario, a 3-Dimensional walk-through of the building helps significantly in increasing the efficiency of the ground forces while operating. 3. The software which needs to be developed should take the 2-Dimensional blueprint layout as input and also should take various parameters like length, breadth, height of the building, layout of staircase, entry and exit, etc as additional inputs. The software should then export them to a file and create a full fledged 3-Dimensional walkthrough model of the building. The software must also include the facility for integration of exported model to the offline Google maps, Satellite pictures (if any available). 4. Since the target includes buildings which are secretive in nature, the software is required to be operable fully in standalone mode, without any internet connectivity required in future. For the initial installation phase, the system can be connected to the internet to facilitate fetching up of Maps, satellite imagery from open source, etc required for the software functioning. 5. This software would also reduce the time taken during the initial briefing of the troops prior to the launch of any operation. It further increases the efficiency of the operations, thus resulting in early success. 6. The conversion of 2-Dimensional blueprints to 3-Dimensional models must address following problems. (a) Software should take 2-Dimensional blueprint as an input and produce 3- Dimensional walk through as output. (b) Provisions to input parameters like length, breadth, height of the building and other details should be included. (c) Minimum supervision from the user end should be needed to finalise the conversion. (d) Offline integration with Google maps, satellite imagery to get enhanced output covering the nearby geographical areas as well.",
